/**
 * Running time: 604739ms
 * Even though we add another thread to help with the counting,
 * the running time is so much slower. Why?
 * The answer is excessive contentionâ€”too many threads are trying to
 * access a single shared resource simultaneously. In our case,
 * the consumers are spending so much of their time with the counts
 * map locked that they spend more time waiting for the other to
 * unlock it than they spend actually doing useful work, which leads
 * to horrid performance.
